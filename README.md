# infosys722_iteration-4
This is the assignment for Infosys 722

Important notice: On my side, I can run the three algorithms one by one because I tried to run them in one time but there may occur errors shows that server time out with some eceptions. BUT I run one by one, it works perfectly. So if you have the same problem, you can run them one by one. This doesn't means the code isn't work properly.
